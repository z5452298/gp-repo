/*
This class provides an interface for you to interract with X-Box controllers in your program.
The implementation of these functions are provided to you via the relevant library file that you
must include in your assignment (see setup notes).
Include this file in your controller module and use the public interface as required.
During testing at home, if an xbox controller is not available feel free to switch over to keyboard
input mode (explained below) which permits you to use the same interface but accepts keyboard input
rather than expecting an X-Box controller to be connected and used.
